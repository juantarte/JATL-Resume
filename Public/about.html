<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am dedicated to the sale and programming of GPS devices for all types of vehicles.</p>

<p>Additionally, I dedicate myself to programming web pages, mainly my own.</p>

<p>And as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, I started a sewing business with my wife Daphne,
  in which we make a little bit of everything except clothing.</p>
